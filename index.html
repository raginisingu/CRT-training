           <big><big><b>nature</b> then we wouldnâ€™t be alive. The health benefits of nature for humans are incredible. The most important thing for survival 
             given by nature is <i>oxygen</i>. The entire cycle of respirationis regulated by nature. The oxygen that we inhale is given by trees 
             and the carbon dioxide we exhale is getting absorbed by trees. 
             The ecosystem of nature is a community in which producers (plants), consumers, and decomposers work together in 
             their environment for survival. The natural fundamental processes like<mark>soil creation, photosynthesis, nutrient cycling, 
             and water cycling, allow Earth to sustain life</mark> . We are dependent on these ecosystem services daily whether or not we are aware.
             Nature provides us services round the clock: provisional services, regulating services, and non-material services. 
             Provisional services include benefits extracted from nature such as food, water, natural fuels and fibres, and medicinal plants.
             Regulating services include regulation of natural processes that include <u>decomposition, water purification, pollution, erosion and
             flood control, and also, climate regulation</u>.<strike> Non-material services are the non-material benefits that improve
             the cultural development of humans</strike> such as recreation, creative inspiration from interaction with nature like art, music,
             architecture, and the influence of ecosystems on local and global cultures. </p></big></big>
